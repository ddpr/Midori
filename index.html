                The wonder of the world is gone I know for sure
                All the wonder that I want I found in her
                As the whole becomes a part I strike to burn
                And no flame returns
                Every intuition fails to find it's way
                One more table turned around I'm back again
                Finding I'm more lost and found when she's not around
                When she's not around I feel it coming down
                Give me what I could never ask for
                Connect me and you could be my chemical now
                Give me the drug you know I'm after
                Connect me and you could be my chemical
                When everybody wants you (The chemical goes slow)
                When everybody wants you (The chemical gets)
                Slow and
                Everybody wants you
                So
                Slow and
                Everybody wants your soul
                Give me what I could never ask for
                connect me and you could be my chemical NOW
                Give me the drug you know I'm after
                Connect me and you could be the chemical
                You could be the chemical
                You could be the chemical
                You could be the chemical
                You could be the chemicals</pre>
